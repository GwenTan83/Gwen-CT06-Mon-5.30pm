## Recap 1: Product of 5 numbers

# Write a program to calculate the product (multiplication) of 5
# numbers.

# 1. Using a for loop, ask the user for 5 numbers one at a time.
# 2. Calculate the multiplication for these 5 numbers and print
#    it out.
# ans = 1
# for (i) in range(1, 6):
#     userResponse= int(input("What is number #" + str(1) + "? "))
#     ans= ans * userResponse
# print("The product of the 5 numbers is" + str(ans))

# import time

# start = int(input("What number do you want to start from?"))

# for i in range(start, 0, -1):
#     print(i)
#     time.sleep(1)

# print("Liftoff!")

import random
#start
