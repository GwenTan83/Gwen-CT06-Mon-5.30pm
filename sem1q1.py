# Task 1
# Print numbers from 10 to 200 using the while loop
# Your numbers must be in multiples of 10.
# 10 must be first number printed, and 200 the last number.

# Example: 10, 20, 30 ..... 180, 190, 200.
# Note that the numbers do not need to be printed in one line.
# Write your code here
number=0
while True:
    number=number+10
    print(number)
    if number==200:
        break

# Task 2
# Code a password checker to protect your code!

# Assign a password "superpass123" to a variable
# Ask the user to enter a password
# If the password matches, print “Access Granted”
# If the password does not match, print “Access Denied”

# Write your code here

# Pw=input("What is your password?")
# if Pw=="superpass123":
#     print("Access granted!")
# else:
#     print("Access denied!")
